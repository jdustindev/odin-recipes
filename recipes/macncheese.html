  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    This easy mac and cheese is baked in the oven for a quick meal. A friend of mine sent me this recipe when I got my first apartment because she knew I hated cooking! It's really easy — even I can make it — and it tastes great. I'm not sure where she found the recipe. (from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14140/baked-macaroni-and-cheese/)
